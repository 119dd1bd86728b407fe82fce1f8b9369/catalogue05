Hi there! Thanks for testing out my second Github repository &amp;amp; attempt to implement a Playstation 4 webkit vulnerability test! So you are aware: I did not discover this exploit, and I also did not write most of this code. So far, I have started off with modifying existing code to begin to learn how this all works. Let me know how your experience went!  More information on this vulnerability from Google's Project Zero team: https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/0day-RCAs/2021/CVE-2021-30858.html  This test will not modify/harm your device in any way, nor will it access your data or make your Playstation explode. All this will do is see if you are vulnerable.

<blockquote>
This is a boot2root VM and is a continuation of the Basic Pentesting series. This series is designed to help newcomers to penetration testing develop pentesting skills and have fun exploring part of the offensive side of security.  VirtualBox is the recommended platform for this challenge (though it should also work with VMware -- however, I haven’t tested that).  This VM is a moderate step up in difficulty from the first entry in this series. If you’ve solved the first entry and have tried a few other beginner-oriented challenges, this VM should be a good next step. Once again, this challenge contains multiple initial exploitation vectors and privilege escalation vulnerabilities.  Your goal is to remotely attack the VM, gain root privileges, and read the flag located at /root/flag.txt. Once you’ve finished, try to find other vectors you might have missed! If you’d like to send me a link to your writeup, enjoyed the VM or have questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at: josiah@v...

<blockquote>
 Microsoft  acknowledged a critical remote code execution  vulnerability (CVE – 2020 - 1350) existing in  Windows Domain Name System (DNS) when it  fails to properly handle requests. An adversary  who successfully exploits the vulnerability could  run arbitrary code or malicious code in the  context of the Local System Account. And this  vulnerability rests on the DNS client while it  handles specific requests. This means that an  attacker who does not perform an  authentication can gain control of an account  that exists locally on the system, even remotely.  This will allow the host to reach a complete  compromise. T

# GitHub search -> TP-Link exploit RCE
# SPYthon

https://github.com/ZimSec/SPYthon
<blockquote>
The idea for this project is to create a multi-threaded python server that will generate HTML reports on what exploits can be run against what host. First, the user will create a new session with the host and give the host an IP. Based on whether or not that IP can be scanned passively (if it exists in Shodan/Censys) it will ask the user if this is owned or allowed infrastructure to scan. If the user consents, the server will scan the host with Nmap and determine what versions the host is running and if their services are vulnerable. If the user does not approve the server will not scan the host. If the given host has already been scanned by Censys/Shodan then those results will be fed into the server via API's. The server/script will then determine if the vulnerability has a given exploit, which it will then display to the user along with the ports in a report that is in HTML format.

針對近期微軟公布修補遭駭客攻擊的Exchange Server漏洞問題，台灣DEVCORE表示早在1月5日便已發現安全漏洞後，並且向微軟通報此項編號命名為「CVE-2021-26855 」，以及「CVE-2021-27065」的零日漏洞，同時也將此項漏洞稱為「ProxyLogon」。  此次揭露的「ProxyLogon」漏洞，是以無需驗證即可使用的遠端程式碼執行 (Pre-Auth Remote Code Execution；Pre-Auth RCE)零日漏洞(Zero-day exploit)，可讓攻擊者得以繞過身份驗證步驟，驅使系統管理員協助執行惡意文件或執行指令，進而觸發更廣泛的攻擊。  「ProxyLogon」是微軟近期被揭露最重大的RCE漏洞之一，DEVCORE團隊遵循責任揭露 (Responsible Disclosure)原則，在發現後便第一時間立即於今年1月5日通報微軟進行修補，避免該漏洞遭有心人士利用，造成全球用戶重大損失。而微軟遂於3月2日針對相關漏洞釋出安全更新，避免用戶機敏資訊遭受惡意攻擊。個人想法:遭駭客攻擊的Exchange Server漏洞問題，台灣DEVCORE表示早在1月5日便已發現，並且向微軟通報此項編號命名為「CVE-2021-26855 」，以及「CVE-2021-27065」的零日漏洞，同時也將此項漏洞稱為「ProxyLogon」。  此次揭露的「ProxyLogon」漏洞，是以無需驗證即可使用的遠端程式碼執行 (Pre-Auth Remote Code Execution；Pre-Auth RCE)零日漏洞(Zero-day exploit)，可讓攻擊者得以繞過身份驗證步驟，驅使系統管理員協助執行惡意文件或執行指令，進而觸發更廣泛的攻擊。  「ProxyLogon」是微軟近期被揭露最重大的RCE漏洞之一，DEVCORE團隊遵循責任揭露 (Responsible Disclosure)原則，在發現後便第一時間立即於今年1月5日通報微軟進行修補，避免該漏洞遭有心人士利用，造成全球用戶重大損失。而微軟遂於3月2日針對相關漏洞釋出安全更新，避免用戶機敏資訊遭受惡意攻擊。個人想法:微軟是大眾常用的軟體之一，駭客只要察覺漏洞就會進行惡意的攻擊，微軟公布4個Exchange Server的安全漏洞後，就遭受駭客的惡意攻擊，這件事的發生，...

# Consumer-Protection

https://github.com/shubh2902/Consumer-Protection
<blockquote>
Consumer Protection  Consumers are said to be the king in a free market economy, The earlier approach of Caveat Emptor which means ‘Let the buyer beware’ has now changed to Caveat Venditor which means ‘Let the seller beware’. With growing competition and increased sales and market share, manufacturers and service providers are engaged in unhealthy, exploitative and unfair trade practices. This means that a consumer might be exposed to risk due to unsafe products, misleading advertisements etc. Thus, there is a need for providing adequate protection to consumers against such practices of the sellers. What is consumer protection  Consumer protection refers to ‘the protection of physical, economic and other interest of the consumers from exploitation by the business community’. The consumers are being protected by restricting the mall practices through legislature and other measures.  Importance of consumer protection  Consumer protection has a wide agenda. It not only includes educating ...

# Malware-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

https://github.com/mohd-tanveer/Malware-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
<blockquote>
Current antivirus software’s are effective against known viruses, if a malware with new signature is introduced then it will be difficult to detect that it is malicious. Signature-based detection is not that effective during zero-day attacks. Till the signature is created for new (unseen) malware, distributed to the systems and added to the anti-malware database, the systems can be exploited by that malware. But Machine learning methods can be used to create more effective antimalware software which is capable of detecting previously unknown malware, zero-day attack etc. We propose an approach that learns from the header data of PE32 files. We examine various features of the PE32 header and check those which are suitable for machine learning classifier. We hypothesize that machine learning classifiers can tell apart the difference between malware and benign software. Various machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision tree, Logistic Regression and Naive Baye...

First we need to find some information about the system. So we are going to start by opening up nmap to be able to scan  So after running that you should of gotten the number of ports and that should be answer to the second thing needed. This is used so We can find out how open it is and we can level it by how vulnerable it is. In this one it is MS17-01o this vulnerability is marked as arisk level of critical  Now we know how vulnerable it is time to exploit it. For this step we are going to run Metasploit to open the terminal usein the search msfconsole in the terminal and search (MS17–010) You should know  which exploit to use at this point so, let’s run it. Type show options to be able to know which parameter is needed to run as a prerequisite and be able torun the exploit. Once the exploit and the parameters are set, run the exploit  After running the exploit you will see that you have gained the shell of the target machine You did it!!

<blockquote>
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the HTTP protocol stack (HTTP.sys) that is caused when HTTP.sys improperly parses specially crafted HTTP requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of the System account.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Windows HTTP stack handles requests.

https://github.com/priyankgada/The-Complete-Practical-Certified-Ethical-Hacking-Course-in-English
<blockquote>
Welcome this comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in hacking and by the end of it you'll be able to hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts!  This course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory, so we'll start with ethical hacking basics and the different fields in penetration testing, installing the needed software (works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and then we'll dive and start hacking systems straight away. From here onwards you'll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting computer systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc, so we'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit theses weaknesses and hack i...

# GitHub search -> TP-Link exploit RCE
# Bluekeep-POC

https://github.com/sherlocksecurity/Bluekeep-POC
<blockquote>
BlueKeep is a use-after-free vulnerability, meaning that the program tries to use memory after it is supposed to have discarded it. The vulnerability lies in termdd.sys, which is the RDP kernel driver. A user can exploit this by opening an RDP connection to a remote computer called a channel – in this case a default RDP channel called MS_T210 – and sending specially crafted data to it. The exploit runs code on Windows XP, they said, but warned that it would probably crash Windows 7 or Server 2008 machines. By sending a specially crafted packet an attacker is able to set the value for the Channel ID to something the RDP service isn’t expecting, this causes a memory corruption bug that will create the conditions for Remote Code Execution to occur. Should the attacker choose to follow up with packets designed to take advantage of this flaw remote code execution can be achieved with System user privileges. There are no payloads. This is just a PoC. HOWEVER it is easily ported to an exploit...
