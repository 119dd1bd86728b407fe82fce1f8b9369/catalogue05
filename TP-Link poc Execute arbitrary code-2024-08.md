Remote code execution (RCE) refers to a class of cyberattacks in which attackers remotely execute commands to place malware or other malicious code on your computer or network.

# PPS_Project

https://github.com/jonschumaker/PPS_Project
<blockquote>
Consider  the  design  of  a  database  for  a  web  site  that  allow  people  to  buy  and  sell  a  cypto called PPS (see website testing.ppswap.org). Only registered users can buy and sell PPS. Each user is identified by a userid, which is an email, first name, last name, birthday, address (street number, street, city, state, and zip code), balance of PPS and balance of dollar.  Initially, both PPS and dollar balances are zero. A user can withdraw and deposit dollars. A special user root (this is the only user whose id is root and not an email) initially will have the whole supply of PPS, which is 1T. A user will sell and buy PPS only with this special user root (in real life, this special root might be just a smart contract). The price of the PPS is set to 1M/$ initially. For the simplicity of this project, we assume each buy will increase the price by a little: each dollar can buy 1 less PPS after each buy. In the same way, each sell will decrease the price a little bit:  each  d...

Hi there! Thanks for testing out my second Github repository &amp;amp; attempt to implement a Playstation 4 webkit vulnerability test! So you are aware: I did not discover this exploit, and I also did not write most of this code. So far, I have started off with modifying existing code to begin to learn how this all works. Let me know how your experience went!  More information on this vulnerability from Google's Project Zero team: https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/0day-RCAs/2021/CVE-2021-30858.html  This test will not modify/harm your device in any way, nor will it access your data or make your Playstation explode. All this will do is see if you are vulnerable.

# glowing-computing-machine

<blockquote>
Amazon announced a new device called the Glow during its fall product launch event, a $250 video chatting gadget that allows children to virtually interact with loved ones by playing games and reading books together. Although the company has been selling the Echo Dot Kids Edition for years, it's rare for Amazon to develop an entirely new device designed specifically for children.   While it's new for Amazon, the general concept behind Glow might sound familiar -- especially if you've ever used the storytelling app Caribu or the Osmo brand of educational tablet accessories. That's because although they're different products, they share a lot of underlying qualities with Amazon's Glow. Caribu is designed to help kids play games and read stories with relatives remotely through an interactive video chatting platform, and Osmo is all about incorporating real-world game pieces into educational games you can play on a tablet.

# CVE-2021-41773-Apache-RCE

https://github.com/pwn3z/CVE-2021-41773-Apache-RCE
<blockquote>
A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &amp;quot;require all denied&amp;quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. Th...

Git is a free, open source, distributed version control system used for managing code on small, medium and large projects.  GitHub is a web-based Git hosting service.  It is mostly used for computer code, and is used by software development professionals not just for code management, but for archival and sharing of code and projects amongst each other, and for potential clients/employers to see.  Use of GitHub is an extremely common way for software developers to internetwork as well.  Learning about and using GitHub (or, perhaps, similar tools) will be a key part of your software development career.  For this second step in completing your Final Project, you'll need to:  Submit what you've completed so far with the zip folder of your project. Create a document of your project, what you have completed, what problem you have, and what is your next step. Create a GitHub repository to upload your final project.

https://github.com/m96dg/CVE-2021-41773-exercise
<blockquote>
A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &amp;quot;require all denied&amp;quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.

<blockquote>
WPF Partial Trust Security Article 10 minutes to read In general, Internet applications should be restricted from having direct access to critical system resources, to prevent malicious damage. By default, HTML and client-side scripting languages are not able to access critical system resources. Because Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) browser-hosted applications can be launched from the browser, they should conform to a similar set of restrictions. To enforce these restrictions, WPF relies on both Code Access Security (CAS) and ClickOnce (see WPF Security Strategy - Platform Security). By default, browser-hosted applications request the Internet zone CAS set of permissions, irrespective of whether they are launched from the Internet, the local intranet, or the local computer. Applications that run with anything less than the full set of permissions are said to be running with partial trust. WPF provides a wide variety of support to ensure that as much functionality as possible ca...

https://github.com/sud0x00/log4j-CVE-2021-44228
<blockquote>
On December 5, 2021, Apache identified a vulnerability (later identified as CVE-2021-44228) in their widely used Log4j logging service. The vulnerability, also known as Log4shell, enables attackers to gain full control of affected servers by allowing unauthenticated remote code execution if the user is running an application utilizing the Java logging library. Log4j is heavily integrated into a broad set of devops frameworks, enterprise IT systems, and vendor software and cloud products.

1-Project Title “Library Management System (L_I_B_R_A)” The “Library Management System” has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardship faced by this existing system. Moreover this system is designed for the particular need of the institution to carry out operating in a smooth and effective manner. 2-Domain Library management institutional management non-profitable organization. 3-Problem of Statement In our existing system all the transaction of books are done manually, so taking more time for a transaction like borrowing a book or returning a book and also for searching of member and books. Another major disadvantage is that to preparing the list of book borrowed and the available book in the library will take more time, currently it is doing as a day process for verifying all records. So after conducting he feasibility study we decided to make the manual library mana...

One can add images in different albums of their choice. Make the view page of images as much beautiful as you can. Along with it, one can add description to an image. Arrange the images in such a sequence in which they are mostly liked and mostly commented.  Add a secret code for each image. The one with the link and secret key can see the image. An authenticated user can add comments and likes on the image of other user but can only access it with given link and secret key.  Elaboration- Every image has a link and each image has a secret key, the user who has created will be accessed to create the key and view the image on login without key. But the unauthenticated users are also given the access to see the image with a given link, when they touch the link, they need enter a secret key so that they can see ...

About lichess dev lichess.org is a free/libre, open-source chess server powered by volunteers and donations.  In 2017, Official began work on Lichess as a hobby project. The site was simple at the beginning, not even checking to see if moves were legal. He made the site open source, which means anyone is free to read the source code and make contributions. Gradually, the site improved and collected users as an enthusiastic volunteer staff assembled to help Thibault build and maintain the site.Vlounteer's may can fork on our Git project  Today, Lichess users play more than a million games every day. Lichess is one of the most popular chess websites in the world while remaining 100% free. Most “free” websites subsist by selling ads or selling user data. Others do it by putting all the good stuff behind paywalls. Lichess does none of these things and never will. With no investors demanding profits, Lichess staff can focus on improving the site as their only goal.  Despite Lichess's humble...

Doing it individually is a time taken job hence I have created this colab notebook for the same.  Through this colab notebook we have tried to make a simple free web based old photo editor so that this can be easily used by any person with limited technical knowledge. And this appears like a web page for restoring their personal photos. Click on the play button at the corner of each code block. There are two code blocks. The first one is to download pre trained models, hence it takes some time. This first block needs to be executed only once for a session. The ...

# Complete-NodeJS

https://github.com/ArpanMaheshwari144/Complete-NodeJS
<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

Pricing and Matching  Scenario. Consider the scenario in which a shop has a number of promo codes to incentivize the customers that buy an item to buy a different item. The customers can belong to different classes and the promo codes can provide different discounts.  Environment. Imagine two items (referred to as first and second items; for each item we have an infinite number of units) and four customers’ classes. The daily number of customers of each class is described by a potentially different (truncated) Gaussian probability distribution. Each class is also associated with a potentially different conversion rate returning the probability that the user will buy the first item at a given price.  Once a buyer has bought the item, she/he can decide to buy the second item that can be or not promoted.

# Cross-Site-Scripting-XSS-Attack

<blockquote>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability commonly found in web applications. This vulnerability makes it possible for attackers to inject malicious code (e.g. JavaScript programs) into victim’s web browser. Using this malicious code, attackers can steal a victim’s credentials, such as session cookies. The access control policies (i.e., the same origin policy) employed by browsers to protect those credentials can be bypassed by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.

 Microsoft  acknowledged a critical remote code execution  vulnerability (CVE – 2020 - 1350) existing in  Windows Domain Name System (DNS) when it  fails to properly handle requests. An adversary  who successfully exploits the vulnerability could  run arbitrary code or malicious code in the  context of the Local System Account. And this  vulnerability rests on the DNS client while it  handles specific requests. This means that an  attacker who does not perform an  authentication can gain control of an account  that exists locally on the system, even remotely.  This will allow the host to reach a complete  compromise. T

The Financial Technology company (Fin-Tech Company) launch there a mobile app. This app used for financial purposes like bank loans, savings, etc. in one place. It has two versions free and premium. The free version app contains basic features and customer wants to use the premium feature then they have to pay some amount to unlock it.The main goal of the company is to sell the premium version app with low advertisement cost but they don’t know how to do it. That’s a reason they are provided the premium feature in the free version app for 24 hours to collect the customer’s behavior. After that, the company hired the Machine Learning Engineer to find insight from the collected data (customer’s behavior).  The job of the ML engineer is to find or predict new customer who is interested to buy the product or not. If the customers will buy a product anyway so no need to give an offer to that customer and loss the business. Only give offers to those customers who are interested to use premiu...

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the HTTP protocol stack (HTTP.sys) that is caused when HTTP.sys improperly parses specially crafted HTTP requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of the System account.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Windows HTTP stack handles requests.

https://github.com/sudipchakraborty/Forward-Kinematics-Demonstration-Using-CoppeliaSim-and-C-
<blockquote>
Robot researchers need the simulator to test their functions and algorithm before implementing into the real robot. Most of the time, a customizable Robot simulator is not available to the researcher. Some good options are available in the market, but their price is too high, not affordable. After much research, we found a better solution around all aspects, fully customizable and entirely free of cost. There are two sides. One is a 3D view of robotics ARM, and another is a joint controller of robotics ARM. For 3D simulation, CoppeliaSim is the best option. It is free of cost and Open Source. The C&amp;&#35;35; language is becoming famous for its managed code structure and ease of implementation. Our Robot controller is in the C&amp;&#35;35; language. For control and debug we use Microsoft visual studio 2019. It is an unparallel IDE for the programmer. In the CoppeliaSim little bit, Lua script is in associated functions. Communication Between the simulator and our application, we will use Remote API F...

The program does clever things with passwords, but there isn’t a lot of code in it, so it won’t take long to make.

<blockquote>
Cross Site Scripting is a major vulnerability that is often exploited by hackers for website hacking. It is one of the more difficult vulnerabilities to deal with because of the way it works. Some of the largest websites in the world have dealt with successful XSS attacks including Microsoft and Google.  Most XSS website hacking attacks use malicious Javascript scripts that are embedded in hyperlinks. When the user clicks the link, it might steal personal information, hijack a web session, take over a user account, or change the advertisements that are being displayed on a page.  Hackers will often insert these malicious links into web forums, social media websites, and other prominent locations where users will click them. To avoid XSS attacks, website owners must filter user input to remove any malicious code.

Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.  To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set.  For example, suppose you have the following list:  1-3 a: abcde 1-3 b: cdefg 2-9 c: ccccccccc Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain...

<blockquote>
Welcome to my comprehensive course on python programming and ethical hacking. The course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in any of these topics, and by the end of it you'll be at a high intermediate level being able to combine both of these skills to write python programs to hack into computer systems exactly the same way that black hat hackers do. That's not all, you'll also be able to use the programming skills you learn to write any program even if it has nothing to do with hacking.  This course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory, we'll start with basics of ethical hacking and python programming and installing the needed software. Then we'll dive and start programming straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by writing useful hacking programs, no boring dry programming lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each aims to achieve a specific goal, the goal is usually to hack into a certain system! We'll start by learning how this syst...

Part I - WeatherPy In this example, you’ll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you’ll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.  Your first objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.  Your next objective is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):  Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Humi...

<blockquote>
PYTHON CODE WALKTHROUGH Data Sourcing In order to run a discounted cash flow model (DCF), I needed data, so I found a free API that provided us with everything I needed. I wrote a code that saved every financial statement of every company in a separate text file. In this code, I asked to ping the API’s URL for every ticker, open a text file for one of the financial statements for one company ticker, dump all the data found by the code into this file, and close it. This process was repeated for every company in our company list and every statement I have a code for. By doing so I Ire able to store the data for every company locally and did not need to ping the API every time I ran our code. Once all the financial data for each company was stored in form of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and company profile text file, I needed to pick out specific items required for our DCF model. Thus, I defined the functions that selected all required items from the respective ...

<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

# Bluekeep-POC

https://github.com/sherlocksecurity/Bluekeep-POC
<blockquote>
BlueKeep is a use-after-free vulnerability, meaning that the program tries to use memory after it is supposed to have discarded it. The vulnerability lies in termdd.sys, which is the RDP kernel driver. A user can exploit this by opening an RDP connection to a remote computer called a channel – in this case a default RDP channel called MS_T210 – and sending specially crafted data to it. The exploit runs code on Windows XP, they said, but warned that it would probably crash Windows 7 or Server 2008 machines. By sending a specially crafted packet an attacker is able to set the value for the Channel ID to something the RDP service isn’t expecting, this causes a memory corruption bug that will create the conditions for Remote Code Execution to occur. Should the attacker choose to follow up with packets designed to take advantage of this flaw remote code execution can be achieved with System user privileges. There are no payloads. This is just a PoC. HOWEVER it is easily ported to an exploit...

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

# XSS-Scanner

https://github.com/17BCE0951/XSS-Scanner
<blockquote>
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.   An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.   These 3 types of XSS are defined as follows:    Stored XSS (AK...

# Safe-Communication-using-Polyalphabetic-Substitution-Cipher-Homophonic-Cipher

https://github.com/TanmayiNandan/Safe-Communication-using-Polyalphabetic-Substitution-Cipher-Homophonic-Cipher
<blockquote>
The need for a secure communication gives rise to concept of cryptography. Data encryption or ciphering translates data into another form, or code, so that only people with access to a secret key (formally called a decryption key) or password can read it. Encrypted data is commonly referred to as ciphertext, while unencrypted data is called plaintext. Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. Computational cryptography deals with the storage and processing of sensitive information in computer systems by enciphering. Sensitive information is information that for some reason must be protected from being disclosed to individuals without proper authorization. Cryptographic techniques appear to be one of the most simple and secure methods of ...

<blockquote>
SEIS 665 Assignment 2: Linux &amp;amp; Git Overview This week we will focus on becoming familiar with launching a Linux server and working with some basic Linux and Git commands. We will use AWS to launch and host the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don’t worry, we will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with all the details.  Requirements You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. You should also read the Git Hands-on Guide and Linux Hands-on Guide before beginning this exercise.  A word about grading One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes. Automation is utilized during the assignment grading process to review and assess your work.  It’s important that you follow the instructions in each assignment and type i...

<blockquote>
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.  Extra:  Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

# CSRF-Prevention

https://github.com/AnuCS/CSRF-Prevention
<blockquote>
Implementing Cross-site Request Forgery protection in web applications via Double Submit Cookies Patterns  This app is a demonstration of how to prevent CSRF with double submit cookie patterns. What happens here is, a CSRF token is included in 2 places of a web form. One in the form itself and the other as a cookie. At the point of form validation, server side code checks if the token in the cookie and the token in the form are the same. If it is the same it's safe to process the information from the form.  This demonstration has 4 files in it. the index.php file contains the login form and the validation code for the login. At the point of login, it creates a CSRF token and sets a cookie from it. The protected.php file contains the are protected by the login, which is a contact form. When the page loads, a javascript code extracts the CSRF token from the cookie string and adds it into a hidden field in the form.

<blockquote>
 Cross Referencing Tables and Forms Used by a Form      [Back]  Here is a unix script, formtables.shl, which shows which tables are used by the given Oracle form, and how they are used (Select or List of values (LOV), Update, Insert, Delete, or undetermined), which can be used on .fmb (form) and .pll (library) files.   It parses the strings in the form file, and makes a best guess effort in determining the tables used by the form, matching the string patterns against a file listing the non-system tables in the database (generated by formtables.sql).   Since it doesn't analyze the code or trace through the function calls in the attached libraries, or look at database triggers for side effects of table changes, it may not find some table references, but, it does a pretty good job on most form files.   For Banner users, it also shows which forms are called by this form, including form access (query only, etc.).  You will first need to run formtables.sql from sqlplus (using @formtables.sql...

There are two versions of each web application, the one version demonstrates the vulnerability and the other demonstrates a mitigation techinuqe. The first vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting attack and the second vulnerability is Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.

<blockquote>
CodeSnippet CSharp on How to create an alphanumeric string for use as a password or an Number for any entity. On many occasions you may need to create a unique password or identifier string. There are already methods out there to create random strings of a given or variable length. I have taken the concept and modified it to suit my own need. Basically I create an array of characters and an array of numbers (removing any that may be easy to confuse). I then pass a parameter to determine how long the string will be. Finally I use a combination of the char string and a string of numbers to create my desired length output string (consisting in this case of 3 Hard coded letters followed by &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; then 4 numbers, then &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; lastly followed by 6 alphanumeric values).You can adapt it to other languages or make it part of your existing C&amp;&#35;35; Library.

<blockquote>
Pebblecoin    UPDATE 2015/12/31: Version 0.4.4.1 is now out.  The major change is optimizing the daemon to use less RAM.  It no longer keeps all the blocks, which are rarely needed, in RAM, and so RAM usage has decreased from around 2 gigabytes, to under 200 megabytes.  Mac binaries are also now available.  The new wallet is compatible with the old wallet - simply turn off the old wallet, and start the new wallet, and the blockchain will update automatically to use less RAM.  Code: Release Notes 0.4.4.1 - (All) Fix blockchain RAM usage, from almost 2 GB to less than 200 MB   - Seamless blockchain conversion on first run with new binaries - (Qt) Fix high CPU usage - (Qt) Fix sync indicator (&amp;&#35;35; of total blocks) - (Mac) Mac binaries - Technical Notes:   - (All) Blockchain disk-backed storage with sqlite3 and stxxl   - (Mac) Fix mac compilation   - (All) Update build files &amp;amp; instructions for linux, mac, windows   - (All) Remove unused protobuf and OpenSSL dependencies for Qt wallet ...

<blockquote>
This is a Sudoku puzzle game that I created for a Web Programming class at UVU. There are five difficulty levels which, the harder the difficulty the more blank cells that the puzzle starts out with. My Sudoku puzzles are created with random numbers and a back-tracking algorithm. Generating our own puzzles was not required for the project, but I really wanted to make it work anyways. Having an infinite number of Sudoku puzzles to play through just makes it that much cooler :-D. This project uses some game features such as using Ajax for loading the puzzles, the player is able to check the board at any time for incorrect answers, a timer that tells how long the player has been working on the given puzzle, a high-scores list (fabricated) and a list of recent players using XMLHttpRequest and XML or JSON files, and also uses HTML5 Media features such as Audio Tags and Canvas functionalities for drawing simple graphics such as the title of the Screen &amp;quot;SUDOKU&amp;quot; floating in to the pa...

# MemoryIssues

https://github.com/nishadchenicheri/MemoryIssues
<blockquote>
We have created an iOS hybrid app[Cordova IOS 3.8.0, SQLite(Cordova-SQLite-Storage) 0.7.10-pre] and noticed that there is huge memory consumption while we perform any CRUD operations. We tried to debug the app by enabling each feature at a time and found that the memory consumption is high when there is a SQLite plugin call. The memory consumed is never released even after we are idle for few minutes. To ensure that the memory consumption is from the SQLite plugin, we created a new project which performed the below operations ·         as a single record, ·         as a batch operation, ·         with a loop of n records ·         with a loop of n batches   The source code is uploaded,  for the sample project in this repository. Instruments captured during analysis is also attached, for following operations,       1. Insert - with a (batch of 100 records each) * 100 loop       2.
