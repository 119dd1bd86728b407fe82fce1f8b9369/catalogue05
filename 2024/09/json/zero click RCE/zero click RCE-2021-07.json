Doing it individually is a time taken job hence I have created this colab notebook for the same.  Through this colab notebook we have tried to make a simple free web based old photo editor so that this can be easily used by any person with limited technical knowledge. And this appears like a web page for restoring their personal photos. Click on the play button at the corner of each code block. There are two code blocks. The first one is to download pre trained models, hence it takes some time. This first block needs to be executed only once for a session. The ...",

Originally we would use the HTA attack feature provided by the setoolkit tool, by which we could broadcast our payload via a direct link and we would have a meterpreter session when the victim would double click on that payload. If you want to know about HTA attack, you can read from below.",
