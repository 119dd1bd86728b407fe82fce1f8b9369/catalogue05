Likewise, timing isn't great for finding code injection because you can normally find those better by using OAST techniques. For powerful vulnerabilities like command injection, SQLi, and code injection, timing-based detection is only really useful when you've got a WAF or filtering in place that blocks the classic detection techniques.

An arbitrary code execution vulnerability is a security flaw in software or hardware allowing arbitrary code execution. A program that is designed to exploit such a vulnerability is called an arbitrary code execution exploit.

CVE-2022-1388 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the REST      component of BIG-IP’s iControl API that was assigned a CVSSv3      score of 9.8. The iControl REST API is used for the management and      configuration of BIG-IP devices. CVE-2022-1388 could be exploited      by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the management      port or self IP addresses of devices that use BIG-IP. Exploitation would      allow the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, create and      delete files and disable services.

Weevely Weevely is a command line web shell dynamically extended over the network at runtime, designed for remote administration and penetration testing. It provides a ssh-like terminal just dropping a PHP script on the target server, even in restricted environments.  The low footprint agent and over 30 modules shape an extensible framework to administrate web accounts and post exploit web servers escalating privileges and moving laterally in the network.  Read the Wiki for tutorials and uses cases.  The modules feature:  Ssh-like terminal Run SQL console pivoting on target Proxy your HTTP traffic pivoting on target Host configurations security auditing Mount target file system locally Conduct network scans pivoting on target File upload and download Spawn reverse and direct TCP shells Bruteforce internal services Manage compressed archives The backdoor agent The remote agent is a small PHP script which can extend its functionality over the network at run-time.

<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

<blockquote>
Mouse Payload Loader (MPL) is a post exploitation surveillance tool written in Python, C and Objective-C. It gives you a command line session with extra functionality between you and a target machine with simple MPL payload. MPL gives you the power and convenience of uploading/downloading files, tab completion, taking pictures, location tracking, shell command execution, persistence, escalating privileges, password retrieval, and much more.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

We will use AWS to launch and host the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don’t worry, we will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with all the details.  Requirements You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. You should also read the Git Hands-on Guide and Linux Hands-on Guide before beginning this exercise.  A word about grading One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes.

MySQL-Fu is a Ruby based MySQL Client Script I wrote.  It does most of the stuff a normal MySQL client might do: SQL Shell, Update/Delete/Drop Database/Table, Add/Delete Users, Dump Database(s)/Table w/ option for gzip...... Plus a few extra options  to make life a little easier for pentests. Includes Several builtin PHP Command Shell options as well as Pentestmonkey's PHP Reverse Shell, in addition to multiple options for file writing and reading (all files read logged locally for offline analysis later), also includes Ruby port of Kingcope's CVE-2012-5613 Linux MySQL Privilege Escalation Exploit.
