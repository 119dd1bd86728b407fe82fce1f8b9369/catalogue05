Under 'android' exploits for the Android RCE vulnerability (CVE-2017-0781), and the SDP Information leak vulnerability (CVE-2017-0785) can be found.  Under 'linux-bluez' exploits for the Linux-RCE vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000251) can be found (for Amazon Echo, and Samsung Gear S3).  Under 'l2cap_infra' a general testing framework to send and receive raw l2cap messages (using scapy) can be found.  Under 'nRF24_BDADDR_Sniffer' a tool to capture bluetooth mac addresses (BDADDR) over the air, using a nRF24L01 chip  For more details on BlueBorne, you may read the full technical white paper available here:  https://www.armis.com/blueborne/  In addition a several detailed blog posts on the exploitation of these vulnerability can be found here:  https://www.armis.com/blog/  ===============  Dependencies:",
