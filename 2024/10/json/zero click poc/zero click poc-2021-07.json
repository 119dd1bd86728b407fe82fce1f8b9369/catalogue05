Doing it individually is a time taken job hence I have created this colab notebook for the same.  Through this colab notebook we have tried to make a simple free web based old photo editor so that this can be easily used by any person with limited technical knowledge. And this appears like a web page for restoring their personal photos. Click on the play button at the corner of each code block. There are two code blocks.
