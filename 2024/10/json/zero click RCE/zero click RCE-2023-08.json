Each user is identified by a userid, which is an email, first name, last name, birthday, address (street number, street, city, state, and zip code), balance of PPS and balance of dollar.  Initially, both PPS and dollar balances are zero. A user can withdraw and deposit dollars.

A user will sell and buy PPS only with this special user root (in real life, this special root might be just a smart contract). The price of the PPS is set to 1M/$ initially. For the simplicity of this project, we assume each buy will increase the price by a little: each dollar can buy 1 less PPS after each buy. In the same way, each sell will decrease the price a little bit:  each  d...",
