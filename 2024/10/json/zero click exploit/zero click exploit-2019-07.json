The output is shown as “YES” for phishing URL and “NO” for not phished URL.

Also, this will help gather data on random guessing of numbers given time and other factors. There is this little understanding/ knowledge which is by intuition that individuals guessing of numbers at a certain time of the day in the presence of some factors could be predicted given data of previous guessing. That is, individual have favorite numbers even if they are just guessing at a point in time. Guess king is a proposed interactive application or game that will engage uses in guessing and predicting numbers. It will have single player and multiplayer mode. Single player mode will feature the application generating a random number, and three other random numbers to form a set of number and ask the user / player to predict the first number generated with 3 options. Should the user/ player get the first guess write, he / she scores 5 point ...",
