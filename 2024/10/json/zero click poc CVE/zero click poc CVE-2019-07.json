Also, this will help gather data on random guessing of numbers given time and other factors. There is this little understanding/ knowledge which is by intuition that individuals guessing of numbers at a certain time of the day in the presence of some factors could be predicted given data of previous guessing.

Should the user/ player get the first guess write, he / she scores 5 point ...",
